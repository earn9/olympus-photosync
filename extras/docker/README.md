# README

Basic docker image to build this project. Thought to be used via pipelines in Jenkins.

Based on [this project](https://github.com/mauriciojost/docker-mauriciojost-scala).


To build, install:

```
sudo apt-get install docker-ce
```

Then launch:

```
bash build.sh
```

(you will need an account at `docker.com` to publish your image).
